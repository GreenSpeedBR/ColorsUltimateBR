To use these tools, you need to extract the game files and copy the "dvd_builder_image" folder into the "sonic2010" folder. 
Your workspace must look like the example image.

To make new texts: edit the XML corresponding to the part you want. The files are:

ev_msg.xml - Cutscenes
hint.xml - Hints (duh)
achievement_dynamic_text.xml - Achievements
new_dynamic_text.xml - Interface texts

As these files came with version 1.0 of the game, the texts for the new cosmetics from the December patch are not available. If you can add them without crashing the game, let me know.

To convert, just run the corresponding "convert.bat"

The subtitle files will be in "\dvd_builder_image\sonic2010\event" as "evXXX_seq.arc"
The hint files will be in "ui" folder
The new interface texts will be named "new_dynamic_text.arc" inside "\dvd_builder_image\sonic2010"
